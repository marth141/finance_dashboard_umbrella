# FinanceDashboard.Umbrella
This application is going to be used as a replacement to my old Google Sheet bills tracker.

Ecto is used to be able to insert bills into the database. Phoenix Framework, AlpineJS, and TailwindCSS provide all the frontend tooling for an interface.

There is still quite a bit needing to be done here if we're being honest...

## Running Project

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `apps/finance_dashboard_web/assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
